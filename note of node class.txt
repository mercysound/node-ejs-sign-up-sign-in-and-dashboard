for the data base we are using non-relational database is mongodb
mongodb as a localstorage call cluster.
Inside  a cluster as many data base can be created.
URI - Uniform resourse identification - to identify each user id
mongoose make conneting to dataabase very easy.
Note: we can connect with database without mongoose but mongoose make it better.

 formal way to connect db
// to connect database
// mongoose.connect(URI, (err)=>{
//   if(err){
//     console.log("mongoose no gree connect");
//     console.log(err);
//   }else{
//     console.log("mongoose connected succcessfuly");
//   }
// })

Standard things to know about when it comes to backend:
1. schema - The structure of collection(non-relational) or table(relational)
You use regular expression to validate
you use query to check what they are sending
structure check the formation way of sending it.
to validate both of the server and database
let userSchema: {
firstname:{type:String, require: compulsory, currentTimeStamp: help know reg time},
lastname: String,
email: {type:String, unique:"goToDataBaseToCheckAva"}
password: String
}

2. Model - in case of mongodb is what join schemal (,)and  name of user-collection
in other word - what collection you want to use and (userSchema) and typeOf struct
ure.

in the newer version of express it as inbuit.
middleware is app.use.

we will be mongoose to interact with our mongodb; mongoose can also be use.
URI - uniform resource identification: this help locate particular source online
Constrain- determine the type of data..
Note: to connect with db - can use mongodb installation or mongoose to connect





In this example:

The useUnifiedTopology option is used to 
enable the new unified topology engine introduced in version 4.0.0.

The connection string is a placeholder, and you 
should replace it with your actual MongoDB connection string.

The MongoClient is created with the new options, and the 
connection is established using the connect method.

Ensure that you handle errors appropriately and close 
the MongoDB client when you are done with it.

By making these adjustments, you'll address the
 deprecation warning related to the useNewUrlParser option.
